This is a local springboot JAVA API'S app & SQL Database

This application simply tests the MVC artchitecture by using HTTP calls in Flutter utilizing the CRUD functionalities
1. RETRIEVE/GET and Display all data stored in the SQL Database
2. PUT/CREATE data in the database
3. UPDATE data using ID's from the database
4. DELETE data from the database using ID's

I utilized the mvc structure to get a better understaning on how Models and entities communicate to the repository by using inbetween classes such as the controller and service classes.

The Front End part of this app uses a simple flutter framework and widgets containing input textboxes and buttons
